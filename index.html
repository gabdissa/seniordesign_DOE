For our final project, we have decided to design a website using civil rights data from the Department of Education's website. We have used the dataset from the 2015-2016 school year. Our goal for this website is for it to be informative and user-friendly for anyone to use. To access the data visualizations, you can click on any of the "explore" buttons on the homepage, or the tabs at the top of this page. The topics we focused on are: Chronic Absenteeism, SAT and ACT, Expenditures, Course Enrollment and more. Enjoy! Click <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2015-16.html">here to access the 2015-2016 CRDC dataset. </a>
